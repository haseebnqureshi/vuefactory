### Get Started in Seconds
1. ```npm install vuefactory -g```;
2. ```vuefactory``` and answer the prompts;
3. ```npm start```!

### NPM Module
We've shoved all of this into an easy-to-manage NPM package. This makes way more sense as a REPL CLI tool, helping you to quickly scaffold your next Vue application with powerful out-of-the-box addons.

Happy coding!
