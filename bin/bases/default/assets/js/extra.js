If you don't want to bundle any javascript together, you 
can drop those scripts in this folder, and it'll translate 
to your www build. Just don't use the reserved 'bundle.js' 
filename.

(And oh yeah, you'll have to specifically load this from
your html, since you're not wanting to bundle it in your
app.js.)
